# Update AGENTS.md Command

Update the AGENTS.md file with your completed work and current status.

When you complete tasks or reach a checkpoint, use this command to document:

- What you accomplished
- Files you modified
- Current blockers or issues
- Next steps and priorities

This keeps the project's shared context up to date for other agents.

## Usage

Use `/update-agents` to remind yourself to update the AGENTS.md file with your session's work.
