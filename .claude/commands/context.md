# Context Command

Read the AGENTS.md file to understand the current project state and context.

This command helps ensure you're aligned with the project's current status, goals, and any ongoing work by other agents.

## Usage

Use `/context` at the start of a session to get up to speed on:

- Project overview and goals
- Current progress and status
- Architecture and tech stack decisions
- Any blockers or issues
- Upcoming tasks and priorities
