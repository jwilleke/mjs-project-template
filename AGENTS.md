### DRY principle

The coding standard for "do not repeat yourself" is the **DRY principle**, which states that every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation in a system.

Generrally, if you see repated logic more than two times it should be refractered into reusable components.

To achieve this, developers should abstract repeated logic into reusable components like functions, classes, or modules, and avoid duplicating code to improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and simplify updates
