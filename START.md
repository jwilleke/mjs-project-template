# START.md - AGENTS Session Initialization

First: Read "GLOBAL-CODE-PREFERENCES.md" for project principles before starting. The file "GLOBAL-CODE-PREFERENCES.md" is located at:

```bash
smb://tank.nerdsbythehour.com/jims/data/systems/GLOBAL-CODE-PREFERENCES.md
or
nfs://tank.nerdsbythehour.com/jims/data/systems/GLOBAL-CODE-PREFERENCES.md
```

## Initialization

First agent should copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/jwilleke/mjs-project-template) to root of project folder:

- AGENTS.md
- .vscode
- .editorconfig
- .eslintrc.json
- .markdownlint.json
- .prettierignore
- .prettierrc.json

For Developer projects:

- ARCHITECTURE.md
- DOCUMENTATION.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_STANDARDS.md

After copying, Read AGENTS.md and project folder and modify the following to fit project:

- AGENTS.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md

## After Initialization

### CRITICAL: Read Project Context First

Please read and analyze the `AGENTS.md` file completely. This file contains:

- Current project status and progress
- Tech stack and architecture decisions
- Completed work from previous sessions
- Current issues and blockers
- TODO items and next steps
- Context needed to understand the project

## Your Tasks for This Session

1. Read `AGENTS.md` - Understand the full current state
2. Assess Status - Report back on:
   - What is the current project status?
   - What work has been completed?
   - What are the current blockers or issues?
   - What are the high-priority tasks?
3. Plan Work - Recommend which tasks we should focus on this session
4. Execute - Work on the prioritized tasks
5. Update AGENTS.md - When work is complete, update the file with:
   - What you accomplished
   - Files you modified
   - Any new issues discovered
   - Updated status and next steps
   - Today's date and that Claude worked on this

## Key Files

- `AGENTS.md` - READ THIS FIRST - Shared context for all agents
- Project files and directories as described in AGENTS.md

## Expected Workflow

1. I will read AGENTS.md
2. I will report the current state
3. We will discuss what to work on
4. I will complete the work
5. I will update AGENTS.md with progress
6. Ready for next session (by Claude or Gemini)

Let's begin: Please read AGENTS.md and tell me what you find.
