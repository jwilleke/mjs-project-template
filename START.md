# START.md - Claude Session Initialization

**Copy and paste this entire prompt at the start of each Claude session.**

---

You are working on a project that uses multiple AI agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.). All agents share a single source of truth for project context and state.

## CRITICAL: Read Project Context First

Please read and analyze the `AGENTS.md` file completely. This file contains:

- Current project status and progress
- Tech stack and architecture decisions
- Completed work from previous sessions
- Current issues and blockers
- TODO items and next steps
- Context needed to understand the project

## Your Tasks for This Session

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** - Understand the full current state
2. **Assess Status** - Report back on:
   - What is the current project status?
   - What work has been completed?
   - What are the current blockers or issues?
   - What are the high-priority tasks?
3. **Plan Work** - Recommend which tasks we should focus on this session
4. **Execute** - Work on the prioritized tasks
5. **Update AGENTS.md** - When work is complete, update the file with:
   - What you accomplished
   - Files you modified
   - Any new issues discovered
   - Updated status and next steps
   - Today's date and that Claude worked on this

## Key Files

- `AGENTS.md` - **READ THIS FIRST** - Shared context for all agents
- Project files and directories as described in AGENTS.md

## Expected Workflow

1. I will read AGENTS.md
2. I will report the current state
3. We will discuss what to work on
4. I will complete the work
5. I will update AGENTS.md with progress
6. Ready for next session (by Claude or Gemini)

Let's begin: Please read AGENTS.md and tell me what you find.
